# Execute Task

Implement a feature using using the Task file.

## Task File: $ARGUMENTS (Mandatory)

## Execution Process

1. **Load TASK**
   - Read the specified TASK file
   - Understand all context and requirements by referring to requirements.md and design.md
   - Follow all instructions in the Task and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the Task fully
   - Understand the existing code base (if existing) and update the applicable sections of the task file wherever applicable.
   - Review the current state and future state and update accordingly.
   - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed
   - Do not rerun the task if already completed. Terminate the request with a message "All the tasks were implemented", in case user tries to rerun the same task again.

2. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow.

3. **Execute the plan**
   - Review the task file
   - Restore the point (time-to-time) for easy reversal in case of big code changes
   - Execute the Task
   - Understand the start and end of the code block targeted for modification
   - When referring to a particular part of the code, use line numbers, function names, or variable names to precisely identify the target for modification.
   - Implement all the code
   - Mark each of the 'ToDo Task' in the task file as completed ([X]).

4. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command
   - Fix any failures
   - Re-run until all pass

5. **Complete**
   - Ensure all checklist items done
   - Mark the ToDo Task as done to avoid rerun of the todo tasks.
   - Run final validation suite
   - Report completion status along with the updated / created files list.
   - Review the code changes for logical errors.
   - Read the requirements again to ensure you have implemented everything

6. **Reference the Task**
   - You can always reference the Task again if needed

Note: 
- If validation fails, use error patterns in Task to fix and retry.
- Do not regenerate the code for unless it is impacted by the current implementation
- Ensure coding standing and guidelines were followed while generating the code
- Check if any of the unit test to be updated / created.
- Do not break the existing functionality while implementing the other
- Summarize the changes did for the Task with respect to the Project structure.
- Suggest the probable changes to be considered in future refactoring based on the current code understanding
- Mark the executed tasks as completed in the task file to avoid rerun of the same task in the next iteration.
- Review the code changes against the to do task list to identify the logical errors. 
- Once the output is generated, Score the task generated by using claude codes to evaluate its quality on a scale of (1-10)
