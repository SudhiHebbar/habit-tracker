- **Sequential**: task_011 → task_012 → task_013 → task_014 (UI dependency chain)
- **Parallel**: task_015 can start in parallel with task_013

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **task_003 → task_004**: Database schema changes could impact repository implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough schema review before repository implementation
   - **Buffer**: Add 1 day buffer between tasks

2. **task_006 → task_007**: Habit management complexity could delay completion tracking
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize core habit CRUD before advanced features
   - **Buffer**: Focus on MVP completion tracking initially

3. **task_011 → task_012**: Dashboard implementation complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Implement basic dashboard first, enhance with customization
   - **Buffer**: Separate core dashboard from advanced features

### Critical Path Management
**Critical Path**: task_001 → task_005 → task_006 → task_007 → task_011 → task_012 → task_013 → task_014

- **Total Duration**: 37 days (7.4 weeks)
