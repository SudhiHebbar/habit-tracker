# Task 016: Fix Progress Tracking Updates Bug

## Requirement Reference
- Bug Report: GitHub Issue #9 - "Today's and This Week's progress not updating when habit is completed"
- Related to: Dashboard progress tracking and real-time state updates

## Task Overview
Fix critical bug where progress tracking metrics ("Today's Progress", "Completed Today", "Active Streaks") are not updating in real-time when habits are completed from the dashboard. The issue prevents users from seeing immediate feedback on their habit completion progress, impacting the core user experience of the habit tracking application.

**Root Cause Analysis**: The dashboard components have static progress calculations that don't refresh when the underlying habit completion state changes. The completion API works correctly, but the frontend state management doesn't propagate completion changes to the dashboard statistics components.

## Dependent Tasks  
- task_007_habit_completion_tracking.md (✅ Completed - completion API infrastructure exists)
- task_011_dashboard_ui_implementation.md (✅ Completed - dashboard components exist)

## Tasks
- Fix dashboard state management to refresh progress metrics after habit completion
- Implement optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Add proper event propagation from completion components to dashboard statistics
- Ensure streak calculations update correctly after completion toggles
- Add comprehensive testing for progress tracking scenarios
- Validate performance impact of real-time updates

4. **Optimistic Updates**: Ensure immediate UI feedback while API calls are processing
5. **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing of completion-to-progress flow
6. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure updates don't cause excessive re-renders
