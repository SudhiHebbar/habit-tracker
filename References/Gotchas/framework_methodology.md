# PRP Framework Methodology: Discover → Plan → Execute

## Overview

The PRP Framework is built on the proven **Discover → Plan → Execute** methodology designed to achieve "right at first" implementation success. This three-phase approach ensures comprehensive context gathering, structured planning, and precise execution while minimizing iterations and rework.

## Core Methodology

### 1. DISCOVER Phase: Comprehensive Context Gathering

**Objective**: Gather all necessary information and context before making any decisions or starting implementation.

#### Key Activities

- **Requirements Analysis**: Complete understanding of what needs to be built/fixed
- **Context Research**: Comprehensive analysis of existing systems, patterns, and constraints
- **Stakeholder Input**: Gather all relevant perspectives and requirements
- **Risk Identification**: Early identification of potential challenges and blockers
- **Success Criteria Definition**: Clear, measurable outcomes and validation methods

#### Validation Checkpoints

Before proceeding to Plan phase:

- [ ] Complete requirements understood and documented
- [ ] All relevant context and constraints identified
- [ ] Potential risks and challenges documented
- [ ] Success criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment confirmed

### 2. PLAN Phase: Structured Design & Strategy

**Objective**: Create detailed, validated implementation strategy with built-in quality gates and risk mitigation.

#### Key Activities

- **Architecture Design**: Detailed technical design following established patterns
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach with validation checkpoints
- **Risk Mitigation**: Specific strategies for identified risks
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation and testing strategies
- **Rollback Plans**: Recovery strategies for high-risk changes

#### Validation Checkpoints

Before proceeding to Execute phase:

- [ ] Detailed implementation plan with clear steps
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies defined
- [ ] Quality gates and validation methods specified
- [ ] Rollback plans for high-risk changes
- [ ] Plan reviewed and approved by stakeholders

### 3. EXECUTE Phase: Precise Implementation

**Objective**: Implement the planned solution with continuous validation and quality assurance.

#### Key Activities

- **Progressive Implementation**: Phased execution following the roadmap
- **Continuous Validation**: Quality gates executed at each checkpoint
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance and quality monitoring during implementation
- **Issue Resolution**: Immediate resolution of any issues that arise
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation of implementation and lessons learned

#### Validation Checkpoints

Throughout execution:

- [ ] Each phase validation checkpoints passed
- [ ] Quality gates successfully executed
- [ ] Performance and security validation completed
- [ ] Integration testing passed
- [ ] Documentation and knowledge transfer completed

## Right at First Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Context Before Action

**Principle**: Never start implementation without complete understanding of the context, requirements, and constraints.

**Application**:

- All templates start with comprehensive discovery phases
- Context gathering includes technical, business, and user perspectives
- Existing patterns and gotchas are documented before starting
- Dependencies and integration points are mapped upfront

### 2. Validation-First Approach

**Principle**: Build validation and quality gates into every phase, not as an afterthought.

**Application**:

- Each phase has specific validation checkpoints
- Quality criteria are defined before implementation starts
- Testing strategies are planned during the design phase
- Continuous monitoring and validation throughout execution

### 3. Risk-Aware Planning

**Principle**: Identify and mitigate risks early in the process, not when problems occur.

**Application**:

- Risk assessment is part of the discovery phase
- Mitigation strategies are planned before implementation
- Rollback plans are prepared for high-risk changes
- Progressive implementation reduces risk exposure

### 4. AI-Optimized Structure

**Principle**: Structure information and context in ways that enable AI assistants to be most effective.

**Application**:

- Complete context provided upfront to AI assistants
- Structured templates that AI can follow consistently
- Clear action keywords and patterns for AI consumption
- Validation commands that AI can execute automatically

## Template Implementation

### How Each Template Follows the Methodology

#### Design Templates (prp_design_universal.md)

- **DISCOVER**: Market research, technical analysis, stakeholder requirements
- **PLAN**: Architecture design, component specifications, implementation blueprints
- **EXECUTE**: Design validation, stakeholder approval, handoff to implementation

#### Task Templates (prp_task_universal.md)

- **DISCOVER**: Context analysis, existing patterns, current state assessment
- **PLAN**: Implementation strategy, risk assessment, validation planning
- **EXECUTE**: Progressive implementation with continuous validation

#### Enhancement Templates (prp_enhancement_universal.md)

- **DISCOVER**: Current feature analysis, user impact assessment, enhancement requirements
- **PLAN**: Enhancement design, backward compatibility, migration strategies
- **EXECUTE**: Feature implementation, testing, rollout with feature flags

#### Bugfix Templates (prp_bugfix_universal.md)

- **DISCOVER**: Bug reproduction, root cause analysis, impact assessment
- **PLAN**: Fix design, regression prevention, testing strategy
- **EXECUTE**: Fix implementation, validation, deployment monitoring

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Built-in Quality Gates

Each phase includes specific quality gates:

1. **Discovery Quality Gates**:

   - Requirements completeness check
   - Context validation
   - Stakeholder alignment confirmation

2. **Planning Quality Gates**:

   - Design review and approval
   - Risk assessment validation
   - Implementation plan feasibility check

3. **Execution Quality Gates**:
   - Progressive validation checkpoints
   - Performance and security validation
   - Integration testing
   - Documentation completeness

### Continuous Improvement

- Success metrics tracked for each phase
- Lessons learned documented for future improvements
- Template refinements based on real-world usage
- Best practices shared across projects

## Tools and Automation

### AI Assistant Integration

- Templates optimized for GitHub Copilot and other AI assistants
- Complete context provided upfront to minimize back-and-forth
- Structured prompts that enable consistent AI performance
- Validation commands that AI can execute automatically

### Development Environment Integration

### For AI-Assisted Development

- **Better Context**: AI assistants receive complete context upfront
- **Consistent Results**: Structured templates enable consistent AI performance
- **Validation Built-in**: AI can execute validation automatically
- **Learning Integration**: AI learns from documented patterns and gotchas

### For Project Success

- **Faster Delivery**: Right-at-first approach reduces time to delivery
- **Higher Quality**: Comprehensive quality gates ensure robust solutions
- **Lower Risk**: Early risk identification and mitigation
- **Better Outcomes**: Clear success criteria and validation methods

## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Projects

1. Start with Discovery phase using appropriate template
2. Complete all validation checkpoints before proceeding
3. Use Planning phase to design comprehensive implementation strategy
4. Execute with continuous validation and monitoring

### For Existing Projects

1. Assess current state using Discovery phase techniques
2. Identify gaps and improvement opportunities
3. Plan enhancements or fixes using appropriate templates
4. Execute with proper validation and quality gates

### For Team Adoption

1. Train team on Discover → Plan → Execute methodology
2. Implement templates gradually, starting with high-impact areas
3. Establish quality gates and validation processes
4. Monitor success metrics and continuously improve

## Conclusion

The Discover → Plan → Execute methodology provides a systematic approach to software development that minimizes rework, ensures quality, and enables "right at first" success. By following this methodology consistently across all PRP templates, teams can achieve better outcomes with less effort while building institutional knowledge and best practices.
