name: "Base Task Template - Context-Rich with Validation Loops"
description: |

## Purpose
Template optimized for AI agents to implement features with sufficient context and self-validation capabilities to achieve working code through iterative refinement.

## Core Principles
1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Global rules**: Be sure to follow all rules in CLAUDE.md
