name: "Base Design Template - Context-Rich with Validation Loops"
description: |

## Purpose
Template optimized for AI agents to implement features with sufficient context and self-validation capabilities to achieve working code through iterative refinement.

## Core Principles
1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Global rules**: Be sure to follow all rules in CLAUDE.md

## Development Workflow

1. [Step 1 — e.g., Domain entity changes require migration and tests]
2. [Step 2 — e.g., Service layer implementation before UI changes]
3. [Step 3 — e.g., RESTful API conventions]
4. [Step 4 — e.g., Frontend error and loading handling]
5. [Step 5 — e.g., Unit tests required for all new features]
