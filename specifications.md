### **A. Core Functionality**

1. **Tracker Creation**: Users must be able to create, name, and manage multiple, distinct habit trackers. Each tracker will act as a container for a specific set of habits (e.g., "Morning Routine," "Fitness Goals," "Professional Development").  
2. **Habit Creation**: Users must be able to easily create new habits within a selected tracker by providing a name, a description, and a target frequency (e.g., daily, 3 times a week, etc.).  
3. **Habit Tracking**: A simple, one-tap mechanism (like a checkbox) must be available on the main dashboard for users to mark a habit as completed for a given day.

### **B. User Interface & Experience**

1. **Dashboard View**: The main screen will display all habits for the currently selected tracker. It will show a clear daily or weekly view, indicating which habits have been completed.  
2. **Tracker Selection**: The UI will provide a simple dropdown or menu to switch between the user's different trackers, or to select a shared tracker.  
3. **Customization**: Users can customize each habit with a color and an icon to make it visually distinct and personalized.  
4. **Minimalist Design**: The overall design should be clean, intuitive, and distraction-free, focusing on ease of use.

### **C. Data & Analytics**

1. **Streaks**: The app will automatically calculate and display the current and longest streaks for each habit, motivating users to maintain consistency.  
2. **Progress History**: Users can view a history of their progress for a specific habit, including a monthly calendar view showing completion and an overall success percentage.  
3. **Detailed Habit View**: Clicking on a habit will show a detailed view with its full history, streaks, and progress.

### **D. Futuristic Development**

1. **Reminders**: The app should be able to send push notifications to remind users to complete their habits at a scheduled time.  
2. **Sharing & Collaboration**: Users can optionally share an entire tracker with another user. For example, a parent can view their child's "Homework" tracker to foster accountability.  
3. **Gamification**: A simple gamification system could be implemented, such as awarding badges or a "level up" status for completing long streaks.  
4. **Data Persistence**: All habit data, trackers, and user settings will be saved to a cloud database to ensure data is synchronized and available across all devices.  
5. **User Authentication**: The initial implementation will focus on core functionality without user authentication. This will be implemented in a future release.

### **E. Technical Stack**

* **Frontend**: React 19 with React Bits for a modern, component-based user interface.  
* **Backend**: C\#, .NET8, Web API, EF Core.  
* **Database**: Azure SQL.
